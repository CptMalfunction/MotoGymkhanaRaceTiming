#Establish a way to put files on the PI we use https://winscp.net/eng/download.php
#Open the CentralUnit solution in vs
#Right click the WebApi project -> Publish
#Publish with a FolderProfile (note Target location)
#Copy the contents of the target location to the PI (say ~/motogymkhana)
cd motogymkhana
#run the app
dotnet WebApi.dll

#NOTE: Currently we only support simulation from a file which will run automatically fom the included Summary.json
#In the future this will probably take more config regarding riders, hardware etc
